What is Grrovy =>

1) Groovy is an optionally typed, dynamic language for the Java platform with many features
that are inspired by languages like Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk, making them available to Java developers using a Java-like syntax.

Groovy: it runs inside the JVM and makes use of Javaâ€™s libraries (together called the Java Runtime Environment, or JRE).

Every Groovy type is a subtype of java.lang.Object.


2) Integration in the opposite direction is just as easy. 
Suppose a Groovy class MyGroovyClass is compiled into MyGroovyClass.class and put on the classpath. 
You can use this Groovy class from within a Java class by typing 

new MyGroovyClass(); // create from Java


3) Groovy has three main enhancements over and above those of
Java: language features, libraries specific to Groovy, and additions to the existing Java
standard classes (known as the Groovy Development Kit, or GDK).

4) Groovy automatically imports the packages groovy.lang.*, groovy.util.*,
java.lang.*, java.util.*, java.net.*, and java.io.*, as well as the classes
java.math.BigInteger and BigDecimal.

*Note that Java automatically imports java.lang.*, but nothing
else.
