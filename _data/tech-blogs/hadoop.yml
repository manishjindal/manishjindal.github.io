    title: Installing SSH
    detail: 'ssh has two main components:</br>
            1. <b>ssh </b> The command we use to connect to remote machines - the client.</br>
            2. <b>sshd </b> The daemon that is running on the server and allows clients to connect to the server.</br>
            The ssh is pre-enabled on Linux, but in order to start sshd daemon, we need to install ssh first. Use this command to do that :</br>
            This will install ssh on our machine. If we get something similar to the following, we can think it is setup properly:'
